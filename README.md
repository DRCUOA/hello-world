What is this about

This a draft of my intro for my first compsci course at the University of Auckland.  

My who am I

I've not studied compsci before but I am very interested in learning about it.  I'm a mature student, 47 with a sucessful business career in large corporates and more recently in a small Kiwi business.  
I live in Auckland with my wife and have 3 children, 2 of whom are at University and my yougest is planning to join them next year.  
My goal is find out enough about coding, and the exeperience of working on coding with other students, to decide if I would like to committ to it as a career change for the last 15 or so productive years of my career.  
I really like the idea of full stack development as I enjoy creating new ways of doing things but I like to understand the whole picture as well as be able to cover all the bases.  I also hope to meet some interesting new people and makes some new connections over the next few months.

My prior coding experience:

No professional level experience - but dabbled with VBA and SQL as part of my finance roles to expand functionality of business applications.  
Have used lot's of Microsoft business tools to advanced user level - Office Suite mainly and more recently PowerAutomate (new Flow) with 365 applications in the context of supporting business process changes.
More recently dabbled with Java , HTML, CSS, JaveScript, PHP, Node.js and R but all at a very basic level.
